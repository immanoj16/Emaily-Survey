# Emaily-Survey

It is a web application where you can send surveys to a numerious amount of emails at one time. And then they can send feedback of that survey to you.

  * You can simply download the repo or clone it
    
    `git clone https://github.com/immanoj16/Emaily-Survey.git`
  * Then install the dependencies - in the root folder as well as in the client folder
    
    `npm install`
    
    Note:- in root folder run this and in client folder also run this
    
  * You have to create a set of api keys in project folder/config/dev.js
     
     list of keys Google api(client id, secret id), mongoURI from mlab.com, cookieKey(any string you want), stripe key(from stripe.com), sendgrid key(sendgrid.com) and redirectDomain.
     
     All keys are in prod.js file in same directory, but it is for production. I have dev.js in my local computer for security purpose I didn't push it.
